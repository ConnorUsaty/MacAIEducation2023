Repository for AI/ML workshops taught through McMaster AI.

## Folder Structure
In the workshops folder there is a folder for each workshop hosted throughout the year. The folders are labelled 1 - 7 indicating the intended order of progression. In each folder you will find a slides folder which contains a powerpoint that introduces the topic and some of the underlying theory. There is also a demo folder which contains a starter and completed version of a mini application project of the workshop topic. This demo was done as a 30-minute code along in person during the workshops taking attendees from the starter code to the finished code. However the code is fairly well commented and reading through the example and running it yourself should still help you understand a real application of the workshop topic using prevalent industry standard libraries.
